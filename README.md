# CardiacRecorder Android_app
**CardiacRecorder** is an app which will allow users to monitor their _Blood pressure_ & _Heart Rate_ data. Unlike other services, CardiacRecorder is free and open source.

It's important to get an accurate blood pressure history so that you have a clearer picture of your risk for heart disease and stroke. A reading that says your blood pressure is lower than it actually is may give you a false sense of security about your health.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/RedRiotPapon/CardiacRecorder/wiki) for documentation, implementation details and history.
